# Scope

This is an investigation into the impact of Solar and Wind energy production

# Ideas

One point to investigate would be to see if there is a correlation between wind
speed forecasts and actual day ahead prices

Forecats is offered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute without the need to register.
Forecast for Scotland for up to 9 days can be found
[here](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=57&lon=4).
I have user the coordinates for Scotland as shown in the Wikipedia article for
Scotland. I consider Scotland to influence the Wind energy production of the entier UK since most wind farms are in Scotland.
